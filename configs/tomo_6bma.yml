# NOTE:
# This is a yaml based scan configuration file that can be directly pass
# to the tomo_step() function
# i.e.
# RE(tomo_step(SCAN_CONFIG.YML))
#
# ##### very important !!  each file plugin(TIFF/HDF5) need to have at least one image to get propor array size info, otherwise RE will fail !!   #####
# ##### long term solution is to pump one image to each file plugin during initialization of AreaDetector (Sept.2019)
